# MCM - Meritorious Winner
Contest: MCM/ICM 2015 
MCM The Mathematical Contest in Modeling
MCM is a contest where teams of undergraduates use mathematical modeling to present their solutions to real world problems.
Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM), an international contest for high school students and college undergraduates. It challenges teams of students to clarify, analyze, and propose solutions to open-ended problems. The contest attracts diverse students and faculty advisors from over 900 institutions around the world.

# Problem
Problem A: Eradicating Ebola
The world medical association has announced that their new medication could stop Ebola and cure patients whose disease is not advanced. Build a realistic, sensible, and useful model that considers not only the spread of the disease, the quantity of the medicine needed, possible feasible delivery systems (sending the medicine to where it is needed), (geographical) locations of delivery, speed of manufacturing of the vaccine or drug, but also any other critical factors your team considers necessary as part of the model to optimize the eradication of Ebola, or at least its current strain. In addition to your modeling approach for the contest, prepare a 1-2 page non-technical letter for the world medical association to use in their announcement.

# Background and Objectives
New medication has been released in the World Medical Association announcement against Ebola virus. Ebola is a lethal epidemic and has resulted in 22522 total cases (13860 laboratory-confirmed cases) and 8994 deaths by 2015 Feb. Our team is faced with a task to build a realistic, sensible, and useful model aiming at the eradication of Ebola by delivering the new medication to the Ebola outbreak places.

Our goals are listed as follows:
* Build mathematical models to estimate spread of Ebola (such as amount of the patients vary with time).
* Analyze the quantity of the medication needed with the number of patients predicted above.
* Set up a feasible delivery system and find the location of delivery.
* Employ a case study on a specific country which, then, can be extended to the world as an example to fight against Ebola.

# Paper
Eradicating Ebola by Medication Estimate-Delivery Network
Summary:
To eradicate Ebola as soon as possible, our team has launched a program called “Ebola Medication Estimate Delivery Network ”(EMED-Network) for World Medical Association to deliver its new medication to the patients who need it. We would like to submit a non-technical introduction of EMED-Network to your association so that you can use it in your announcement to the public.
We take Sierra Leone as a case study to construct our “Ebola Medication Estimate-Delivery Network ” because it has the most Ebola cases for the moment. The medication estimate system predicts that there would be 10740 at the highest point and the need of the medication would be 103063 units. The medication delivery system confirmed the Bo city is the location point. With our EMED-Network, we can finally deliver the medication to the outbreak cities and will eradicate Ebola in Sierra Leone for 89 days.
